gunicorn is needed in requirements to deploy to heroku
git commit -am "Add gunicorn to requirements"

pip install the requirements after adding new things to the requiremnets text and then run heroku again

                                                    HEROKU SLACK NOTES          


you may need to add a proc file

[3:12]  
or run `heroku ps:scale web=1`

[3:13]  
ProcFile should have something like this in it `web:gunicorn app:app`

you need to update your git remote

[3:46]  
run: `git remote -v` (edited)

rosuav [3:50 PM] 
`origin` should be your GitHub

rosuav [3:56 PM] 
You can change the bit before `herokuapp`, but I'm more concerned that you're trying to push to a git:// URI

michaelherman-mentor [3:59 PM] 
just run -> `heroku git:remote -a fathomless-wildwood-38605` to set the proper remote

rosuav [4:00 PM] 
Will that work? The docs say it will _add_  a remote, but not necessarily change one.

[4:00]  
Anyway, I would be inclined to try an HTTPS push.
 
`git remote set-url heroku https://git.heroku.com/fathomless-wildwood-38605.git`

rosuav [4:03 PM] 
Then push.

Apparently your requirements.txt specifies something that can't be found. What are you using of BzrTools? How did you install it?

[4:08]  
Do you specifically need version 2.6.0?

coolhand_luke [4:11 PM] 
added this Plain Text snippet: here is what is in the requirements file.  BzrTools?
Flask==0.12
Flask-Login==0.4.0
Flask-Migrate==2.0.2
Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1
Flask-Script==2.0.5
